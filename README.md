# W-Method â€“ test generation for Finite State Models
The W-method is an algorithm used for construct a test set from a given finite state machine. The set so constructed is a finite set of sequences that can be input to a program whose control structure is modeled by the FSM.

This code is a possible implementation of the W-Method using SCALA programming language for the generation of a tests set given a correct design. The tests set produced will be used as input for some possible implementations derived from the correct model.
